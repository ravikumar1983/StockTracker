# Stock Trading Automation Tool

## Overview

This is a comprehensive stock trading automation and portfolio management application built with Streamlit. The application provides real-time stock data, portfolio tracking, watchlist management, trading rules automation, and performance analytics. It's designed as a multi-page web application that allows users to manage their stock investments with automated trading rules and detailed portfolio analytics.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with a main Streamlit app and multiple page modules, supported by utility libraries for core functionality.

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit for web UI
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts and graphs
- **Layout**: Multi-page application with sidebar navigation
- **State Management**: Streamlit session state for maintaining user data across pages

### Backend Architecture
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance API (via yfinance library) for real-time stock data
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- **Caching**: Streamlit's @st.cache_data decorator for API response caching

### Data Storage
- **Database Integration**: Added PostgreSQL/SQLite database support with file-based fallback
- **Dual Storage Architecture**: 
  - **Primary**: SQLite database for local development (data/trading_app.db)
  - **Production**: PostgreSQL for deployment with DATABASE_URL environment variable
  - **Fallback**: JSON/CSV files when database unavailable
- **Data Structure**: 
  - Portfolio, transactions, watchlist, and trading rules stored in structured database tables
  - Automatic migration between storage methods

5. **Analytics Pipeline**: Portfolio and transaction data processed for metrics and visualizations

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **streamlit**: Web application framework
- **yfinance**: Yahoo Finance API client for stock data
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **plotly**: Interactive data visualization
- **numpy**: Numerical computations

### Data Sources
- **Yahoo Finance**: Primary source for stock prices, company information, and historical data
- **No external database**: All data stored locally

### File Storage Structure
```
data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ portfolio.json          # User's stock holdings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ watchlist.json         # Watchlisted stocks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ transactions.csv       # Trading history
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ trading_rules.json     # Automated trading rules
```

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
- **Environment**: Python 3.7+ required
- **Dependencies**: Install via requirements.txt (implied)
- **Data Directory**: Automatically created on first run
- **Port**: Default Streamlit port (8501)

### Replit Deployment
- **Platform**: Optimized for Replit environment
- **Storage**: Uses Replit's file system for persistence
- **Configuration**: Streamlit page config optimized for wide layout
- **Caching**: TTL-based caching for API responses (60-300 seconds)

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **File-based Storage**: Chosen for simplicity and ease of deployment without external database dependencies
2. **Streamlit Framework**: Selected for rapid development and built-in UI components
3. **Yahoo Finance API**: Free, reliable source for stock data with comprehensive coverage
4. **Modular Page Structure**: Enables clear separation of concerns and maintainable code
5. **Session State Management**: Provides seamless user experience across page navigation
6. **Caching Strategy**: Balances data freshness with API rate limiting

### Security Considerations
- **No Authentication**: Currently designed for single-user local deployment
- **API Rate Limiting**: Implemented through caching to respect Yahoo Finance limits
- **Data Privacy**: All data stored locally, no external data transmission except API calls

### Scalability Considerations
- **File Storage Limitation**: Current approach suitable for single user; would need database for multi-user
- **API Dependencies**: Relies on Yahoo Finance API availability
- **Memory Usage**: Session state and caching may impact memory with large portfolios
